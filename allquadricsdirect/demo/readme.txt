This is a demo of the quadric fitting library, to help users visualize the fitting results it provides.

This will fit a quadric surface to all faces of an input mesh, which must be in the wavefront obj file format.  Note that this demo *only* performs fitting, not segmentation, so it will always fit one quadric to all input data.

Pass the desired obj file on the command line, for example:
aqd_demo ../example_data/default.obj
